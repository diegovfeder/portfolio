# Once You Know the Problem You Can Solve It

**Problem-solving in software development is about understanding before implementing.**

The art of problem decomposition:

1. **Problem Analysis**

   ```typescript
   interface ProblemSpace {
     currentState: SystemState
     desiredState: SystemState
     constraints: Constraint[]
     resources: Available[]
   }
   ```

2. **Solution Strategy**  
   - Break down complex issues
   - Identify dependencies
   - Create test cases
   - Plan incremental steps

3. **Implementation Approach**

   ```typescript
   const solutionSteps = {
     analyze: 'Understand the root cause',
     plan: 'Design the solution architecture',
     implement: 'Write clean, tested code',
     validate: 'Verify against requirements',
     iterate: 'Refine based on feedback'
   }
   ```

4. **Validation Process**  
   - Unit tests
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance
   - Performance metrics

5. **Learning Loop**

   ```typescript
   interface LearningCycle {
     observation: string
     hypothesis: string
     experiment: () => Result
     analysis: (result: Result) => Insights
     adjustment: (insights: Insights) => NextSteps
   }
   ```

Remember: The quality of your solution directly correlates with your understanding of the problem.
