# When to Use a Framework

**A framework is more than just a collection of tools. It's a strategic technical decision.**

Let's explore when and why to choose a framework:

1. **Evaluation Criteria**

   ```typescript
   interface FrameworkDecision {
     projectSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
     teamExpertise: string[]
     timeConstraints: {
       development: number
       learning: number
     }
     businessNeeds: {
       timeToMarket: boolean
       scalability: boolean
       maintenance: boolean
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Common Scenarios**  
   - Enterprise applications
   - Rapid prototyping
   - Standardized team workflows
   - Complex state management

3. **Framework Benefits**

   ```typescript
   const frameworkAdvantages = {
     structure: 'Consistent architecture',
     tooling: 'Built-in development tools',
     community: 'Shared knowledge & plugins',
     maintenance: 'Long-term support'
   }
   ```

4. **Potential Drawbacks**  
   - Learning curve
   - Overhead for simple projects
   - Version lock-in
   - Performance implications

Remember: Choose frameworks based on project needs, not trends.
