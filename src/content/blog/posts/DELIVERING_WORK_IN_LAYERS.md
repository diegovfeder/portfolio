# Delivering Your Work in Layers: A Frontend Perspective

**Getting used to sharing work in progress to make more efficient development decisions.**

As frontend developers, we often aim to craft experiences that are polished, responsive, and accessible—before showing them off to the rest of the team. We sometimes code entire pages or complex features in isolation, striving for pixel-perfect CSS, thoroughly tested logic, and refined interactions. And we rarely share our code or preview links until we feel *completely* confident it’s all good to go.

But let’s be honest: that takes time.

While polishing every detail can feel satisfying, it also poses risks:

1. **Misaligned Expectations**  
   Without early previews of the UI or core logic, your teammates (designers, back-end devs, product managers) may form different mental images of how the feature *should* look or behave. Waiting until the end can lead to big changes late in the game.

2. **Structural Overhauls**  
   If you’re coding a new page and only share it when you think it’s “done,” your team might realize it conflicts with existing routes, user flows, or data structures. You’ll need to rewrite sizable chunks of code to fit the bigger product context.

3. **Context-Less Approvals**  
   A single page or a single component is rarely the entire story. Your coworkers need to understand how the piece you’re building interacts with the rest of the application—navigation, authentication flows, or theming. It’s hard to validate a piece in isolation.

4. **Future Decisions Impact Past Code**  
   If you meticulously finalize one component, then move on to a second, changes in the second might force you to revisit and refactor the first. That can waste a good portion of your initial effort if you haven’t accounted for the bigger picture.

So, consider **delivering your frontend work in layers**:

1. **Focus on a Conceptual Model or Skeleton**  
   Start by laying out a rough application structure: key components, essential routes, or a basic wireframe of how pages connect. Your code might be light on styling and placeholders for data. **It’s not production-ready**—and that’s okay. The goal is to spark discussion early.

2. **Iterate Quickly and Show Often**  
   After coding the bare-bones version, share a deployed preview or a quick screenshot with your team. Ask: “Does this align with our expected user flow? Are we missing any routes or states?” This approach helps you course-correct sooner.

3. **Add Layers of Detail**  
   Once you’ve validated the layout and flow, build in the next layers of styling, animation, accessibility checks, or performance optimizations. Keep the big picture in mind, but refine piece by piece. Show your progress every day—or even every few hours if it’s a small feature—so your team knows exactly where you stand.

4. **Bird’s-Eye View**  
   By layering your work incrementally, you stay aware of how each component interacts with the rest of the product. You don’t end up with a single page that’s “perfect” but doesn’t mesh well with the entire app.

5. **Trust in Collaboration**  
   Sharing half-finished work can feel vulnerable, but teammates and stakeholders who’ve been around the block understand it’s part of a solid workflow. It says, “I value getting early feedback and aligning with the larger product needs,” not “I can’t finish my tasks.” In the end, that honesty and openness will save you from massive refactors and missed deadlines.

**Bottom Line:**  
Delivering in layers—sharing incremental versions of your frontend code—can help you receive feedback sooner, ensure alignment with the broader product, and allow for faster, more efficient development cycles. It’s a senior practice that shows you know how to optimize time and collaboration.

Remember, we don’t write code in a vacuum. Everything you build is part of a greater system, and that system only thrives when every contributor can see—and influence—the bigger picture.
