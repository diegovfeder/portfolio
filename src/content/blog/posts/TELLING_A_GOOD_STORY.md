# Telling a Good Story

**In software development, storytelling is crucial for documentation, presentations, and feature explanations.**

Good technical storytelling follows a clear structure:

1. **Context Setting**

   ```typescript
   /**
    * @context This authentication system was built to handle
    * multi-tenant access with varying permission levels.
    *
    * @background Previous implementation used simple role-based
    * access control which didn't scale with our needs.
    */
   ```

2. **Problem Statement**  
   - Clear issue definition
   - Impact description
   - Stakeholder identification
   - Current limitations

3. **Solution Journey**

   ```typescript
   // The journey from problem to solution
   interface AuthenticationFlow {
     step1: 'Identify the user'
     step2: 'Verify credentials'
     step3: 'Check permissions'
     step4: 'Grant access token'
   }
   ```

4. **Implementation Details**

   ```typescript
   // Show the evolution of the solution
   // Before
   const checkAccess = (user: User) => user.role === 'admin'

   // After
   const checkAccess = (user: User, resource: Resource) => {
     return evaluatePermissions({
       user,
       resource,
       action: 'read',
       context: getCurrentContext()
     })
   }
   ```

5. **Lessons Learned**  
   - Technical insights
   - Process improvements
   - Team dynamics
   - Future considerations

6. **Documentation Best Practices**

   ```typescript
   interface Documentation {
     purpose: string
     assumptions: string[]
     prerequisites: string[]
     stepByStep: string[]
     examples: CodeExample[]
     troubleshooting: Solution[]
   }
   ```

Remember: Every piece of code tells a story. Make it a good one by:

- Starting with the why
- Showing the evolution
- Including real examples
- Documenting edge cases
- Sharing learnings

The best technical stories don't just explain what was builtâ€”they help others understand why decisions were made and how they can apply these lessons to their own work.
